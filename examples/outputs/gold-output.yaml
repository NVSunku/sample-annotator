  name: Thawing permafrost microbial communities from the Arctic, studying carbon
    transformations - Permafrost 712P3D
  ncbi_taxonomy_name: permafrost metagenome
  sample_collection_site: Palsa
  specific_ecosystem: Permafrost
  study_description: A fundamental challenge of microbial environmental science is
    to understand how earth systems will respond to climate change. A parallel challenge
    in biology is to unverstand how information encoded in organismal genes manifests
    as biogeochemical processes at ecosystem-to-global scales. These grand challenges
    intersect in the need to understand the glocal carbon (C) cycle, which is both
    mediated by biological processes and a key driver of climate through the greenhouse
    gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). A key aspect of these challenges
    is the C cycle implications of the predicted dramatic shrinkage in northern permafrost
    in the coming century.
